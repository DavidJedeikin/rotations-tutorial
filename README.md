# Rotation and Transformation Tutorial

This tutorial aims to cover rotations and transformations of points, object and coordinate systems. These two concepts - especially rotations - have the potential to be the source of much confusion if they are not properly understood. They are essential concepts to master before taking on most tasks in robotics, sensor calibration, autonomous vehicles, computer vision and much more. 

The entire tutorial will be written in jupyter notebooks, which allows for an interactive experience. It is advised that you change parameters and variable to ensure your intuition matches the results. 

Final word - I am by no means a Mathematician, and this tutorial is intented to be a starting point on this topic. If you notice mathematical inconsistencies or mistakes - please let me know and we can resolve them.
