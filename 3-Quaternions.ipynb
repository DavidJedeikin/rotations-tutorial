    "As you have previously seen, 3D rotations can be represented by Euler angles. The limitation of this representation is a fundamental issue known as _Gimbal lock_. It is possible to rotate at a particular angle such that two axes of rotation become aligned. At this point one loses a degree of freedom, meaning we may not reach our expected orientation given our rotation angles.\n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see below, by rotating in such a way that the pitch and yaw gimbals are aligned, the roll and yaw axes create the same rotations and a degree of freedom is lost. If we try and convert back to Euler angles, the problem is one-many and is the result is undefined.\n",

    "The nature of gimbal lock links back in part to our assumption about the order in which we rotate. Opting for a different order of rotation will avoid gimbal lock in certain angles, but the issue will spring back somewhere else. With Tait-Bryan angles the issue arises when pitch approaches $\\pm90^{\\circ}$"
